Worked mostly on the API side:
1. Corrected the parameter types so that methods can work correctly.
2. Ran the sp by first creating the DB in SQL Server and then executing the script in Visual Studio.
3. Added the missing methods in the switch case portion of the ServicesController.
Couldn't run since the pfx file for the certificate was missing and after doing a second clone of the original repository I still didn't get the file. Also, installing the certificate didn't generate a pfx file.
